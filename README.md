Hello, I am Mahdi Najari. I'm 18 years old and currently living in Iran. Over the past few years, I've been working extensively with WordPress, HTML, and CSS. However, my focus has shifted significantly towards Python, as I find it incredibly powerful for a wide range of applications, from automation and data analysis to more complex back-end development. Although I still have experience in JavaScript and use it when necessary, Python has become my main area of expertise and interest. I'm eager to deepen my knowledge in Python and apply it to more advanced projects. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and continue this journey of growth and learning together!ðŸª„
