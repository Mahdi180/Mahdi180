# Mahdi Najari 👨‍💻

Hello! I'm **Mahdi Najari**, an **18-year-old** developer from Iran. Over the past few years, I've worked extensively with **WordPress**, **HTML**, and **CSS** 🎨. However, my focus has shifted significantly towards **Python** 🐍, which I find incredibly powerful for a wide range of applications—from automation and data analysis to complex back-end development 🔧.

Although I still use **JavaScript** 💻 when necessary, **Python** has become my main area of expertise and interest 🚀. I'm eager to deepen my knowledge and apply it to more advanced projects 📈. I'm excited to connect with like-minded developers 🤝 and continue growing and learning together 🌱!
